### Running the code

You will need the back-end API running in order for the app to work. Please visit https://github.com/kami4u/libraryApp and follow the instructions on the page.

###To run the front-end code:

1. Check if node and npm installed by doing `$ node -v` and `$ npm -v` else here is the link to download `https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm`
2. In a terminal window do `npm install` to install required modules
3. To run the library APP do `npm start` so APP will be running on `localhost:3000`
4. Now you will be able to interact with the App.
